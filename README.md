IRCCloud Solarized
==================

A [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) userstyle for IRCCloud.

## Installation

* Compile the Sass (use the [online compiler](http://sass-lang.com/try.html) if you don't have one already);
* Copy and paste the resulting CSS into your userstyle software (e.g. Stylish for Firefox);
* Enjoy Solarized.

## Tweaks

The theme is set up for Solarized Light by default, if you want Solarized Dark then the easiest thing to do is change the color Sass variable names around, i.e. `base0` becomes `base00`, `base1` becomes `base01`, `base2` becomes `base02` and `base3` becomes `base03`.
